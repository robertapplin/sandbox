## Description

In this folder I use Docker compose to link together a basic web app, created using the Django framework, to a Postgres database,
and to a worker service which uses Celery and a Redis message broker. The objective is to create a very basic app which has a
good composition for scalability. It will help me learn how services link to each other.

## Tips

None for now
